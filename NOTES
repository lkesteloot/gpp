To do:

    How to avoid overwriting good go files?
        Special header? We can insert this manually as a comment.
    Maybe don't write .go files if they haven't changed.
    Support if statements.
        Requires proper parser.
        Maybe cast strings to runes?
    When adding import make sure it's not already imported.
    Come up with better error-reporting system.
    Support for statements.
    Handle backticks in template.
        Maybe just use "" quotes and escape everything else.
    Handle escaping {{ in template.
        Nah, just get them to write entity for {.
        Test this and document.
        Won't work for non-HTML, like maybe JavaScript.
    Support raw strings ({{{?)
    Strip all comments and newlines from file.
        I think we'd have to blank out all Pos to 0 throughout the tree.

Syntax:

    {{ name }}           -- Expression must be a string.
    {{ "%d %x"(x, y) }}  -- Formatted to string.
    {% func(f,a,b) %}    -- Sub-template. Just a expression statement probably.
    {# if expr #}  {# end (anything) #}
    {# if expr #}  {# else (anything) #}  {# end (anything) #}

Options:

    If {# #} is on a line by itself, with only whitespace before/after, then strip out
        all whitespace and eol. Same with {% %}.
    For "for" loop, provide magic way to know if on first iteration or last iteration.
