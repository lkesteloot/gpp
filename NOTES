To do:

    When adding import make sure it's not already imported.
    Come up with better error-reporting system.
    Handle backticks in template.
        Maybe just use "" quotes and escape everything else.
    Handle escaping {{ in template.
        Nah, just get them to write entity for {.
        Test this and document.
        Won't work for non-HTML, like maybe JavaScript.
    Support raw strings ({{{?)
    Put special header in output file to avoid overwriting.
    Don't write .go files if they haven't changed.

Syntax:

    {{ name }}           -- Expression must be a string.
    {{ "%d %x"(x, y) }}  -- Formatted to string.
    {% func(f,a,b) %}    -- Sub-template. Just a expression statement probably.
    {# if expr #}  {# end #}
    {# if expr #}  {# else #}  {# end #}
    {# for i, e := range ... #}   {# end #}

Options:

    If {# #} is on a line by itself, with only whitespace before/after, then strip out
        all whitespace and eol.
    For "for" loop, provide magic way to know if on first iteration or last iteration.
        Can't do that in general with range expression.
