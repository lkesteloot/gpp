To do:

    Escape strings.
    Figure out syntax.
    Must use bufio throughout.
    Handle backticks in template.
    Handle escaping {{ in template.

Syntax:
    Requirements:
        Needs embedded strings (for speed).
        Needs embedded non-string expressions (for convenience).
        Maybe support "%d" % x syntax for non-strings. Would invoke fmt.Sprintf().
        Could support that throughout the file.
        Need function call for sub-templates.
    Proposal:
        {{ name }}         -- Expression must be a string.
        {{ "%d" % x }}     -- Single parameter formatted to string.
        {% func(a,b,c) %}  -- Sub-template. Just a expression statement probably.
