To do:

    Support if statements.
    When adding import make sure it's not already imported.
    Come up with better error-reporting system.
    Handle backticks in template.
        Maybe just use "" quotes and escape everything else.
    Handle escaping {{ in template.
        Nah, just get them to write entity for {.
        Test this and document.
        Won't work for non-HTML, like maybe JavaScript.
    Support raw strings ({{{?)
    Strip all comments and newlines from file.
        I think we'd have to blank out all Pos to 0 throughout the tree.
    How to avoid overwriting good go files?
        Special header? We can insert this manually as a comment.
    Maybe don't write .go files if they haven't changed.

Syntax:

    {{ name }}           -- Expression must be a string.
    {{ "%d %x"(x, y) }}  -- Formatted to string.
    {% func(f,a,b) %}    -- Sub-template. Just a expression statement probably.
    {# if expr #}  {# end (anything) #}
    {# if expr #}  {# else (anything) #}  {# end (anything) #}

Options:

    If {# #} is on a line by itself, with only whitespace before/after, then strip out
        all whitespace and eol. Same with {% %}.
    For "for" loop, provide magic way to know if on first iteration or last iteration.
