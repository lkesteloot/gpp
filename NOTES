To do:

    Support if statements.
    Support for statements.
    Handle backticks in template.
    Handle escaping {{ in template.
        Nah, just get them to write entity for {.
        Test this and document.
    Support raw strings ({{{?)
    Parse comments?
        They end up at the wrong place.
        But might need +build comments at the top.
        So parse them (add parser.ParseComments to ParseFile()) but strip most out.
    Maybe change "%d" % 5 format to "%d"(5)
        Conceptually, we're "stringing" the arguments.
        Would support multiple parameters:
            "%3d: %02X"(5, 6)

Syntax:
    Requirements:
        Needs embedded strings (for speed).
        Needs embedded non-string expressions (for convenience).
        Maybe support "%d" % x syntax for non-strings. Would invoke fmt.Sprintf().
        Could support that throughout the file.
        Need function call for sub-templates.
    Proposal:
        {{ name }}         -- Expression must be a string.
        {{ "%d" % x }}     -- Single parameter formatted to string.
        {% func(f,a,b) %}  -- Sub-template. Just a expression statement probably.
        {# if expr #}  {# end (anything) #}
